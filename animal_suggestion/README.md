This is a solution to an example interview question.

## Question
Assume we have a small form that asks `"Select your favorite animal"` for which we have a text box.  When the user inputs the letter `a`, a dropdown shows up with a suggestion for an animal whose name starts with `a`, e.g. `ant`.

Write a method `getSuggestion` that given an input string, it will return a recommendation for a valid animal that starts with said string.

## About the solution
This has been scoped down to be a functional solution that can be completed within the time constraints of a technical interview (~45 minutes).  The solution is not perfect, since there's networking considerations, caching abilities, etc.  This is heavily based on the information I provided during a color stack talk.
